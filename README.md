# Data Inheritance Plugin for Pattern Lab

The Data Inheritance Plugin allows patterns to inherit data from patterns within its lineage. This means that data from included patterns is merged with the current pattern. The current pattern's data takes precedence.

## Installation

To add the Data Inheritance Plugin to your project using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) type:

    composer require pattern-lab/plugin-data-inheritance

See Packagist for [information on the latest release](https://packagist.org/packages/pattern-lab/plugin-data-inheritance).

## Usage

After install make sure to generate your site again with:

    php core/console --generate


## Disabling the Plugin

To disable the Data Inheritance plugin you can either directly edit `./config/config.yml` or use the command line option:

    php core/console --config --set plugins.dataInheritance.enabled=false
